## ExecuteProcess

### Description

Runs an operating system command specified by the user and writes the output of
that command to a FlowFile. If the command is expected to be long-running, the
Processor can output the partial data on a specified interval. When this option
is used, the output is expected to be in textual format, as it typically does
not make sense to split binary data on arbitrary time-based intervals.

## ExecuteScript

### Description

Executes a script given the flow file and a process session. The script is
responsible for handling the incoming flow file (transfer to SUCCESS or remove,
e.g.) as well as any flow files created by the script. If the handling is
incomplete or incorrect, the session will be rolled back.

Scripts must define an onTrigger function which accepts NiFi Context and
Property objects. For efficiency, scripts are executed once when the processor
is run, then the onTrigger method is called for each incoming flowfile. This
enables scripts to keep state if they wish, although there will be a script
context per concurrent task of the processor. In order to, e.g., compute an
arithmetic sum based on incoming flow file information, set the concurrent
tasks to 1.

Multiple variables are provided automatically to script contexts:

| Name | Purpose |
| - | - |
| `log` | the logging object used for logging debug, info, warn, and error |
| `REL_SUCCESS` | the "success" relationship |
| `REL_FAILURE` | the "failure" relationship |

### Python Notes

- ExecuteScript uses native Python bindings, which means that any environment packages (e.g. those installed by pip) can be referenced.
- Virtual environments do work.
- It is possible to build MiNiFi - C++ against implementations which are compatible with CPython. CPython v2.7 as well as v3.4 do work, but only one version can be used at a time for a build.
- We recommend building multiple MiNiFi - C++ executables if there is a requirement for operating multiple Python versions or implmentations concurrently.
- Be mindful of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL); While Python scripts will execute concurrently, execution is multiplexed from a single thread. Generally speaking, Python input/output and library calls with native implementations will release the GIL and enable concurrency, but long-running Python code such as loops will block other threads.

### Lua Notes

- Take care to use the `local` keyword where appropriate (such as inside of onTrigger functions and read/write callbacks) as scripts are long-running and this will help to avoid memory leaks.
- The following Lua packages are enabled/available for scripts:
  - `base`
  - `os`
  - `coroutine`
  - `math`
  - `io`
  - `string`
  - `table`
  - `utf8`
  - `package`

#### Python Example: Reading a File

```python
import codecs

class ReadCallback(object):
  def process(self, input_stream):
    content = codecs.getreader('utf-8')(input_stream).read()
    log.info('file content: %s' % content)
    return len(content)

def onTrigger(context, session):
  flow_file = session.get()

  if flow_file is not None:
    log.info('got flow file: %s' % flow_file.getAttribute('filename'))
    session.read(flow_file, ReadCallback())
    session.transfer(flow_file, REL_SUCCESS)
```

#### Python Example: Writing a File

```python
class WriteCallback(object):
  def process(self, output_stream):
    new_content = 'hello 2'.encode('utf-8')
    output_stream.write(new_content)
    return len(new_content)

def onTrigger(context, session):
  flow_file = session.get()
  if flow_file is not None:
    log.info('got flow file: %s' % flow_file.getAttribute('filename'))
    session.write(flow_file, WriteCallback())
    session.transfer(flow_file, REL_SUCCESS)
```

#### Lua Example: Reading a File

```lua
read_callback = {}

function read_callback.process(self, input_stream)
    local content = input_stream:read()
    log:info('file content: ' .. content)
    return #content
end

function onTrigger(context, session)
  local flow_file = session:get()

  if flow_file ~= nil then
    log:info('got flow file: ' .. flow_file:getAttribute('filename'))
    session:read(flow_file, read_callback)
    session:transfer(flow_file, REL_SUCCESS)
  end
end
```

#### Lua Example: Writing a File

```lua
write_callback = {}

function write_callback.process(self, output_stream)
  local new_content = 'hello 2'
  output_stream:write(new_content)
  return #new_content
end

function onTrigger(context, session)
  local flow_file = session:get()

  if flow_file ~= nil then
    log:info('got flow file: ' .. flow_file:getAttribute('filename'))
    session:write(flow_file, write_callback)
    session:transfer(flow_file, REL_SUCCESS)
  end
end
```

## GetUSBCamera

### Description

Gets images from USB Video Class (UVC)-compatible devices. Outputs one flow
file per frame at the rate specified by the `FPS` property in the format
specified by the `Format` property.

Camera frames are captured in a separate background thread and are emitted as
flow files upon capture. The onTrigger of this processor is a NOOP and will
report an error if inputs are flowed into the processor. Because of this, the
standard event/timer driven scheduling options have no effect.

If the Width/Height properties are set, the closest supported image frame
dimensions to the given Width/Height properties are used.

If no Width/Height properties are set, and the camera supports multiple image
size/quality settings, the highest quality is chosen for the given FPS. For
example:

- If the FPS is 10 and the camera supports a maximum of 1920x1080 at this FPS,
  output images will be 1920x780
- If the FPS is 60 and the camera supports a maximum of 320x240 at this FPS,
  output images will be 320x240

### Properties

| **Use Chunked Encoding** | false | true, false | When POST'ing, PUT'ing or PATCH'ing content set this property to true in order to not pass the 'Content-length' header and instead send 'Transfer-Encoding' with a value of 'chunked'. This will enable the data transfer mechanism which was introduced in HTTP 1.1 to pass data of unknown lengths in chunks. |
| Put Response Body in Attribute | | | If set, the response body received back will be put into an attribute of the original FlowFile instead of a separate FlowFile. The attribute key to put to is determined by evaluating value of this property. |
| Always Output Response | false | true, false | Will force a response FlowFile to be generated and routed to the 'Response' relationship regardless of what the server status code received is or if the processor is configured to put the server response body in the request attribute.

## ListenSyslog

### Description

Listens for Syslog messages being sent to a given port over TCP or UDP.
Incoming messages are checked against regular expressions for RFC5424 and
RFC3164 formatted messages. The format of each message is:
(\<PRIORITY\>)(VERSION )(TIMESTAMP) (HOSTNAME) (BODY) where version is
optional. The timestamp can be an RFC5424 timestamp with a format of
"yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SZ" or "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.S+hh:mm", or it can be an
RFC3164 timestamp with a format of "MMM d HH:mm:ss". If an incoming messages
matches one of these patterns, the message will be parsed and the individual
pieces will be placed in FlowFile attributes, with the original message in the
content of the FlowFile. If an incoming message does not match one of these
patterns it will not be parsed and the syslog.valid attribute will be set to
false with the original message in the content of the FlowFile. Valid messages
will be transferred on the success relationship, and invalid messages will be
transferred on the invalid relationship.

### Properties

In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold. Any other
properties (not in bold) are considered optional. The table also indicates any

| **Receive Buffer Size** | 65507 B | | The size of each buffer used to receive Syslog messages. Adjust this value appropriately based on the expected size of the incoming Syslog messages. When UDP is selected each buffer will hold one Syslog message. When TCP is selected messages are read from an incoming connection until the buffer is full, or the connection is closed. |
| **Max Size of Socket Buffer** | 1 MB | | The maximum size of the socket buffer that should be used. This is a suggestion to the Operating System to indicate how big the socket buffer should be. If this value is set too low, the buffer may fill up before the data can be read, and incoming data will be dropped. |
| **Max Number of TCP Connections** | 2 | | The maximum number of concurrent connections to accept Syslog messages in TCP mode. |
| **Max Batch Size** | 1 | | The maximum number of Syslog events to add to a single FlowFile. If multiple events are available, they will be concatenated along with the \<Message Delimiter\> up to this configured maximum number of messages|
| **Message Delimiter"** | \n | | Specifies the delimiter to place between Syslog messages when multiple messages are bundled together (see \<Max Batch Size\> property). |
| **Parse Messages** | true | true, false | Indicates if the processor should parse the Syslog messages. If set to false, each outgoing FlowFile will only contain the sender, protocol, and port, and no additional attributes. |
| **Port** | 514 | | The port for Syslog communication.|

### Relationships

| Name | Description |
| - | - |

## PutSQL

### Description

Executes a SQL UPDATE or INSERT command. The content of an incoming FlowFile is
expected to be the SQL command to execute. The SQL command may use the `?`
character to bind parameters. In this case, the parameters to use must exist as
FlowFile attributes with the naming convention `sql.args.N.type` and
`sql.args.N.value`, where `N` is a positive integer. The content of the
FlowFile is expected to be in UTF-8 format.

## TailFile

### Description

"Tails" a file, or a list of files, ingesting data from the file as it is
written to the file. The file is expected to be textual. Data is ingested only
when a new line is encountered (carriage return or new-line character or
combination). If the file to tail is periodically "rolled over", as is
generally the case with log files, an optional Rolling Filename Pattern can be
used to retrieve data from files that have rolled over, even if the rollover
occurred while NiFi was not running (provided that the data still exists upon
restart of NiFi). It is generally advisable to set the Run Schedule to a few
seconds, rather than running with the default value of 0 secs, as this
Processor will consume a lot of resources if scheduled very aggressively. At
this time, this Processor does not support ingesting files that have been
compressed when 'rolled over'.

## UpdateAttribute

This processor updates the attributes of a FlowFile using properties that are
added by the user. This allows you to set default attribute changes that affect
every FlowFile going through the processor, equivalent to the "basic" usage in
Apache NiFi.

### Properties

The properties in this processor are added by the user. The expression language
is supported in user-added properties for this processor. See the [NiFi
Expression Language Guide](EXPRESSIONS.md) to learn how to formulate proper
expression language statements to perform the desired functions.

### Relationships

| Name | Description |
| - | - |
| success | If the processor successfully updates the specified attribute(s), then the FlowFile follows this relationship. |

### Basic Usage

For basic usage, changes are made by adding a new processor property and
referencing as its name the attribute you want to change. Then enter the
desired attribute value as the Value. The Value can be as simple as any text
string or it can be a NiFi Expression Language statement that specifies how to
formulate the value. (See the [NiFi Expression Language Usage
Guide](EXPRESSIONS.md) for details on crafting NiFi Expression Language
statements.)

As an example, to alter the standard `filename` attribute so that it has `.txt`
appended to the end of it, add a new property and make the property name
`filename` (to reference the desired attribute), and as the value, use the NiFi
Expression Language statement shown below:

- **Property**: `filename`
- **Value**: `${filename}.txt`

The preceding example illustrates how to modify an existing attribute. If an
attribute does not already exist, this processor can also be used to add a new
attribute. For example, the following property could be added to create a new
attribute called `myAttribute` that has the value `myValue`:

- **Property**: `myAttribute`
- **Value**: `myValue`

In this example, all FlowFiles passing through this processor will receive an
additional FlowFile attribute called `myAttribute` with the value `myValue`. This
type of configuration might be used in a flow where you want to tag every
FlowFile with an attribute so that it can be used later in the flow, such as
for routing in a `RouteOnAttribute` processor.
