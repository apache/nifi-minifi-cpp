## ExecutePythonProcessor

### Description 

Executes a script given the flow file and a process session. The script is responsible for handling the incoming flow file (transfer to SUCCESS or remove, e.g.) as well as any flow files created by the script. If the handling is incomplete or incorrect, the session will be rolled back. Scripts must define an onTrigger function which accepts NiFi Context and Property objects. For efficiency, scripts are executed once when the processor is run, then the onTrigger method is called for each incoming flowfile. This enables scripts to keep state if they wish, although there will be a script context per concurrent task of the processor. In order to, e.g., compute an arithmetic sum based on incoming flow file information, set the concurrent tasks to 1. The python script files are expected to contain `describe(procesor)` and `onTrigger(context, session)`.

In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional. The table also indicates any default values, and whether a property supports the NiFi Expression Language.

## ListSFTP

### Description 

Performs a listing of the files residing on an SFTP server. For each file that is found on the remote server, a new FlowFile will be created with the filename attribute set to the name of the file on the remote server. This can then be used in conjunction with FetchSFTP in order to fetch those files.

'Tracking Entities' strategy can pick any entity whose timestamp is inside the specified time window. For example, if set to '30 minutes', any entity having timestamp in recent 30 minutes will be the listing target when this processor runs. A listed entity is considered 'new/updated' and a FlowFile is emitted if one of following condition meets: 1. does not exist in the already-listed entities, 2. has newer timestamp than the cached entity, 3. has different size than the cached entity. If a cached entity's timestamp becomes older than specified time window, that entity will be removed from the cached already-listed entities. Used by 'Tracking Entities' strategy.|

## ListenHTTP

### Description 

Starts an HTTP Server and listens on a given base path to transform incoming requests into FlowFiles. The default URI of the Service will be http://{hostname}:{port}/contentListener. Only HEAD, POST, and GET requests are supported. PUT, and DELETE will result in an error and the HTTP response status code 405. The response body text for all requests, by default, is empty (length of 0). A static response body can be set for a given URI by sending input files to ListenHTTP with the http.type attribute set to response_body. The response body FlowFile filename attribute is appended to the Base Path property (separated by a /) when mapped to incoming requests. The mime.type attribute of the response body FlowFile is used for the Content-type header in responses. Response body content can be cleared by sending an empty (size 0) FlowFile for a given URI mapping.

## ListenSyslog

### Description 

Listens for Syslog messages being sent to a given port over TCP or UDP. Incoming messages are checked against regular expressions for RFC5424 and RFC3164 formatted messages. The format of each message is: (<PRIORITY>)(VERSION )(TIMESTAMP) (HOSTNAME) (BODY) where version is optional. The timestamp can be an RFC5424 timestamp with a format of "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SZ" or "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.S+hh:mm", or it can be an RFC3164 timestamp with a format of "MMM d HH:mm:ss". If an incoming messages matches one of these patterns, the message will be parsed and the individual pieces will be placed in FlowFile attributes, with the original message in the content of the FlowFile. If an incoming message does not match one of these patterns it will not be parsed and the syslog.valid attribute will be set to false with the original message in the content of the FlowFile. Valid messages will be transferred on the success relationship, and invalid messages will be transferred on the invalid relationship.

"Tails" a file, or a list of files, ingesting data from the file as it is written to the file. The file is expected to be textual. Data is ingested only when a new line is encountered (carriage return or new-line character or combination). If the file to tail is periodically "rolled over", as is generally the case with log files, an optional Rolling Filename Pattern can be used to retrieve data from files that have rolled over, even if the rollover occurred while NiFi was not running (provided that the data still exists upon restart of NiFi). It is generally advisable to set the Run Schedule to a few seconds, rather than running with the default value of 0 secs, as this Processor will consume a lot of resources if scheduled very aggressively. At this time, this Processor does not support ingesting files that have been compressed when 'rolled over'.
### Properties 

In the list below, the names of required properties appear in bold. Any other properties (not in bold) are considered optional. The table also indicates any default values, and whether a property supports the NiFi Expression Language.

| Name | Default Value | Allowable Values | Description | 
| - | - | - | - | 
|File to Tail|||Fully-qualified filename of the file that should be tailed when using single file mode, or a file regex when using multifile mode|
|Input Delimiter|||Specifies the character that should be used for delimiting the data being tailedfrom the incoming file.If none is specified, data will be ingested as it becomes available.|
|State File|TailFileState||Specifies the file that should be used for storing state about what data has been ingested so that upon restart NiFi can resume from where it left off|
|tail-base-directory||||
|**tail-mode**|Single file|Single file<br>Multiple file<br>|Specifies the tail file mode. In 'Single file' mode only a single file will be watched. In 'Multiple file' mode a regex may be used. Note that in multiple file mode we will still continue to watch for rollover on the initial set of watched files. The Regex used to locate multiple files will be run during the schedule phrase. Note that if rotated files are matched by the regex, those files will be tailed.|

## UpdateAttribute

### Description 

This processor updates the attributes of a FlowFile using properties that are added by the user. This allows you to set default attribute changes that affect every FlowFile going through the processor, equivalent to the "basic" usage in Apache NiFi.
