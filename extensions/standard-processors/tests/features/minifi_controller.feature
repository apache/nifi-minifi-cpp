Feature: MiNiFi Controller functionalities
  Test MiNiFi Controller functionalities

  Scenario: Flow config can be updated through MiNiFi controller
    Given a GenerateFlowFile processor
    And a file with the content "test" is present in "/tmp/input"
    And controller socket properties are set up
    When all instances start up
    And MiNiFi config is updated through MiNiFi controller
    Then a single file with the content "test" is placed in the "/tmp/output" directory in less than 60 seconds
    And the updated config is persisted

  Scenario: A component can be stopped
    Given a GenerateFlowFile processor
    And a file with the content "test" is present in "/tmp/input"
    And controller socket properties are set up
    When all instances start up
    And the GenerateFlowFile component is stopped through MiNiFi controller
    Then the GenerateFlowFile component is not running
    And the FlowController component is running

  Scenario: If FlowController is stopped all other components are stopped
    Given a GenerateFlowFile processor
    And a file with the content "test" is present in "/tmp/input"
    And controller socket properties are set up
    When all instances start up
    And the FlowController component is stopped through MiNiFi controller
    Then the GenerateFlowFile component is not running
    And the FlowController component is not running

  Scenario: FlowController can be stopped and restarted
    Given a GenerateFlowFile processor
    And a file with the content "test" is present in "/tmp/input"
    And controller socket properties are set up
    When all instances start up
    And the FlowController component is stopped through MiNiFi controller
    And the FlowController component is started through MiNiFi controller
    Then the GenerateFlowFile component is running
    And the FlowController component is running

  Scenario: Queue state can be queried
    Given a GenerateFlowFile processor
    And a LogAttribute processor with the "FlowFiles To Log" property set to "0"
    And the "success" relationship of the GenerateFlowFile processor is connected to the LogAttribute
    And controller socket properties are set up
    When all instances start up
    And MiNiFi config is updated through MiNiFi controller
    Then connection "GetFile/success/PutFile" can be seen through MiNiFi controller
    And 0 connections can be seen full through MiNiFi controller
    And connection "GetFile/success/PutFile" has 0 size and 2000 max size through MiNiFi controller

  Scenario: Manifest can be retrieved
    Given a GenerateFlowFile processor
    And a file with the content "test" is present in "/tmp/input"
    And controller socket properties are set up
    When all instances start up
    Then manifest can be retrieved through MiNiFi controller

  Scenario: Debug bundle can be retrieved
    Given a GenerateFlowFile processor
    And a file with the content "test" is present in "/tmp/input"
    And controller socket properties are set up
    When all instances start up
    Then debug bundle can be retrieved through MiNiFi controller
