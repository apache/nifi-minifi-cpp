Feature: Sending data using InvokeHTTP to a receiver using ListenHTTP
  In order to send and receive data via HTTP
  As a user of MiNiFi
  I need to have ListenHTTP and InvokeHTTP processors

  Scenario: A MiNiFi instance transfers data to another MiNiFi instance with message body
    Given a GetFile processor with the "Input Directory" property set to "/tmp/input"
    And the "Keep Source File" property of the GetFile processor is set to "true"
    And a file with the content "test" is present in "/tmp/input"
    And a InvokeHTTP processor with the "Remote URL" property set to "http://secondary-${scenario_id}:8080/contentListener"
    And InvokeHTTP is EVENT_DRIVEN
    And the "HTTP Method" property of the InvokeHTTP processor is set to "POST"
    And the "success" relationship of the GetFile processor is connected to the InvokeHTTP
    And InvokeHTTP's success relationship is auto-terminated
    And InvokeHTTP's response relationship is auto-terminated

    And a ListenHTTP processor with the "Listening Port" property set to "8080" in the "secondary" flow
    And a PutFile processor with the "Directory" property set to "/tmp/output" in the "secondary" flow
    And PutFile is EVENT_DRIVEN in the "secondary" flow
    And in the "secondary" flow the "success" relationship of the ListenHTTP processor is connected to the PutFile
    And PutFile's success relationship is auto-terminated in the "secondary" flow

    When both instances start up
    Then in the "secondary" container at least one file with the content "test" is placed in the "/tmp/output" directory in less than 60 seconds

  Scenario: A MiNiFi instance sends data through a HTTP proxy and another one listens
    Given the http proxy server is set up
    And a GetFile processor with the "Input Directory" property set to "/tmp/input"
    And the "Keep Source File" property of the GetFile processor is set to "true"
    And a file with the content "test" is present in "/tmp/input"
    And a InvokeHTTP processor with the "Remote URL" property set to "http://minifi-listen-${scenario_id}:8080/contentListener"
    And InvokeHTTP is EVENT_DRIVEN
    And these processor properties are set
      | processor name | property name             | property value                   |

      | InvokeHTTP     | invokehttp-proxy-username | admin                            |
      | InvokeHTTP     | invokehttp-proxy-password | test101                          |
    And the "success" relationship of the GetFile processor is connected to the InvokeHTTP
    And InvokeHTTP's success relationship is auto-terminated
    And InvokeHTTP's response relationship is auto-terminated
