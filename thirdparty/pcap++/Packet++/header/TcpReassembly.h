/**
 * @file
 * This is an implementation of TCP reassembly logic, which means reassembly of TCP messages spanning multiple TCP segments (or packets).<BR>
 * This logic can be helpful in analyzing messages for a large number of protocols implemented on top of TCP including HTTP, SSL/TLS, FTP and many many more.
 *
 * __General Features:__
 * - Manage multiple TCP connections under one pcpp#TcpReassembly instance
 * - Support TCP retransmission
 * - Support out-of-order packets
 * - Support missing TCP data
 * - TCP connections can end "naturally" (by FIN/RST packets) or manually by the user
 * - Support callbacks for new TCP data, connection start and connection end
 *
 * __Logic Description:__
 * - The user creates an instance of the pcpp#TcpReassembly class
 * - Then the user starts feeding it with TCP packets
 * - The pcpp#TcpReassembly instance manages all TCP connections from the packets it's being fed. For each connection it manages its 2 sides (A->B and B->A)
 * - When a packet arrives, it is first classified to a certain TCP connection
 * - Then it is classified to a certain side of the TCP connection
 * - Then the pcpp#TcpReassembly logic tries to understand if the data in this packet is the expected data (sequence-wise) and if it's new (e.g isn't a retransmission)
 * - If the packet data matches these criteria a callback is being invoked. This callback is supplied by the user in the creation of the pcpp#TcpReassembly instance. This callback contains
 *   the new data (of course), but also information about the connection (5-tuple, 4-byte hash key describing the connection, etc.) and also a pointer to a "user cookie", meaning a pointer to
 *   a structure provided by the user during the creation of the pcpp#TcpReassembly instance
 * - If the data in this packet isn't new, it's being ignored
 * - If the data in this packet isn't expected (meaning this packet came out-of-order), then the data is being queued internally and will be sent to the user when its turn arrives
 *   (meaning, after the data before arrives)
 * - If the missing data doesn't arrive until a new message from the other side of the connection arrives or until the connection ends - this will be considered as missing data and the
 *   queued data will be sent to the user, but the string "[X bytes missing]" will be added to the message sent in the callback
 * - pcpp#TcpReassembly supports 2 more callbacks - one is invoked when a new TCP connection is first seen and the other when it's ended (either by a FIN/RST packet or manually by the user).
 *   Both of these callbacks contain data about the connection (5-tuple, 4-byte hash key describing the connection, etc.) and also a pointer to a "user cookie", meaning a pointer to a
 *   structure provided by the user during the creation of the pcpp#TcpReassembly instance. The end connection callback also provides the reason for closing it ("naturally" or manually)
 *
 * __Basic Usage and APIs:__
 * - pcpp#TcpReassembly c'tor - Create an instance, provide the callbacks and the user cookie to the instance
 * - pcpp#TcpReassembly#ReassemblePacket() - Feed pcpp#TcpReassembly instance with packets
 * - pcpp#TcpReassembly#closeConnection() - Manually close a connection by a flow key
 * - pcpp#TcpReassembly#closeAllConnections() - Manually close all currently opened connections
 * - pcpp#TcpReassembly#OnTcpMessageReady callback - Invoked when new data arrives on a certain connection. Contains the new data as well as connection data (5-tuple, flow key)
 * - pcpp#TcpReassembly#OnTcpConnectionStart callback - Invoked when a new connection is identified
 * - pcpp#TcpReassembly#OnTcpConnectionEnd callback - Invoked when a connection ends (either by FIN/RST or manually by the user)
