INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUILDING LEVELDB ON WINDOWS / MSVC++
(Tested with Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express)

1. Install Boost
  You'll need the Boost libraries to compile LevelDB on Windows:
  http://www.boost.org/users/download/
  You'll need at least the following Boost packages:
  - date_time
  - filesystem
  - thread
  - interprocess

2. To create your LevelDB project, choose:
   New -> "Project From Existing Code"
   and point Visual Studio to the leveldb root directory.

3. To just build the benchmarking tools, choose:
   Project Type: "Console application project"

4. In the configuration settings, make sure you include
   Preprocessor definitions: LEVELDB_PLATFORM_WINDOWS;OS_WIN
   You can also add these later in:
   Project -> Properties ->
      Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor Definitions

   Include the root directory of your LevelDB sources in header search paths.
   You can also add this later in:
   Project -> Properties -> 
      Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Additional Include Directories

5. Add boost/lib directory to Linker paths:
   Project -> Properties -> Linker -> General -> Additional Library Dependencies

6. Manually exclude the following files from the build
   (Solution Explorer -> right-click on file -> Exclude from Project)
   - port/port_android.cc
   - port/port_posix.cc
   - util/env_chromium.cc
   - util/env_posix.cc

7. Manually exclude all the *_test.cc and *_bench.cc files you don't want
   to build. There should only be one .cc file with a main() in your project.
