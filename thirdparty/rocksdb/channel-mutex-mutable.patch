Subject: [PATCH] Fix build breakage from lock_guard error (#6161)

Summary:
This change fixes a source issue that caused compile time error which breaks build for many fbcode services in that setup. The size() member function of channel is a const member, so member variables accessed within it are implicitly const as well. This caused error when clang fails to resolve to a constructor that takes std::mutex because the suitable constructor got rejected due to loss of constness for its argument. The fix is to add mutable modifier to the lock_ member of channel.
