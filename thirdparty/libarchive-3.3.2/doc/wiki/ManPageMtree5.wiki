MTREE(5) manual page 
== NAME == 
'''mtree''' 
- format of mtree dir hierarchy files 
== DESCRIPTION == 
The 
'''mtree''' 
format is a textual format that describes a collection of filesystem objects. 
Such files are typically used to create or verify directory hierarchies. 
=== General Format=== 
An 
'''mtree''' 
file consists of a series of lines, each providing information 
about a single filesystem object. 
Leading whitespace is always ignored. 

When encoding file or pathnames, any backslash character or 
character outside of the 95 printable ASCII characters must be 
encoded as a backslash followed by three 
octal digits. 
When reading mtree files, any appearance of a backslash 
followed by three octal digits should be converted into the 
corresponding character. 

Each line is interpreted independently as one of the following types: 
<dl> 
<dt>Blank</dt><dd> 
Blank lines are ignored. 
</dd><dt>Comment</dt><dd> 
Lines beginning with 
'''#''' 
are ignored. 
</dd><dt>Special</dt><dd> 
Lines beginning with 
'''/''' 
are special commands that influence 
the interpretation of later lines. 
</dd><dt>Relative</dt><dd> 
If the first whitespace-delimited word has no 
'''/''' 
characters, 
it is the name of a file in the current directory. 
Any relative entry that describes a directory changes the 
current directory. 
</dd><dt>dot-dot</dt><dd> 
As a special case, a relative entry with the filename 
''..'' 
changes the current directory to the parent directory. 
Options on dot-dot entries are always ignored. 
</dd><dt>Full</dt><dd> 
If the first whitespace-delimited word has a 
'''/''' 
character after 
the first character, it is the pathname of a file relative to the 
starting directory. 
There can be multiple full entries describing the same file. 
</dd></dl> 

Some tools that process 
'''mtree''' 
files may require that multiple lines describing the same file 
occur consecutively. 
It is not permitted for the same file to be mentioned using 
both a relative and a full file specification. 
=== Special commands=== 
Two special commands are currently defined: 
<dl> 
<dt>'''/set'''</dt><dd> 
This command defines default values for one or more keywords. 
It is followed on the same line by one or more whitespace-separated 
keyword definitions. 
These definitions apply to all following files that do not specify 
a value for that keyword. 
</dd><dt>'''/unset'''</dt><dd> 
This command removes any default value set by a previous 
'''/set''' 
command. 
It is followed on the same line by one or more keywords 
separated by whitespace. 
</dd></dl> 
=== Keywords=== 
After the filename, a full or relative entry consists of zero 
or more whitespace-separated keyword definitions. 
Each such definition consists of a key from the following 
list immediately followed by an '=' sign 
and a value. 
Software programs reading mtree files should warn about 
unrecognized keywords. 

Currently supported keywords are as follows: 
<dl> 
<dt>'''cksum'''</dt><dd> 
The checksum of the file using the default algorithm specified by 
the 
[[cksum(1)|http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=cksum&sektion=1]] 
utility. 
</dd><dt>'''device'''</dt><dd> 
The device number for 
.B block 
or 
.B char 
file types. 
The value must be one of the following forms: 

<dl> 
<dt>''format'',''major'',''minor''Bo,''subunit'' Bc</dt><dd> 
A device with 
''major'', minor 
and optional 
''subunit'' 
fields. 
Their meaning is specified by the operating's system 
''format''. 
See below for valid formats. 
</dd><dt>''number''</dt><dd> 
Opaque number (as stored on the file system). 
</dd></dl> 

The following values for 
''format'' 
are recognized: 
.B native , 
.B 386bsd , 
.B 4bsd , 
.B bsdos , 
.B freebsd , 
.B hpux , 
.B isc , 
.B linux , 
.B netbsd , 
.B osf1 , 
.B sco , 
.B solaris , 
.B sunos , 
.B svr3 , 
.B svr4 ,  
and  
.B ultrix .

== BUGS == 
== HISTORY == 
The 
'''mtree''' 
utility appeared in 
BSD 4.3 Reno. 
The 
'''MD5''' 
digest capability was added in 
FreeBSD 2.1, 
in response to the widespread use of programs which can spoof 
[[cksum(1)|http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=cksum&sektion=1]]. 
The 
'''SHA-1''' 
and 
'''RIPEMD160''' 
digests were added in 
FreeBSD 4.0, 
as new attacks have demonstrated weaknesses in 
'''MD5 .''' 
The 
'''SHA-256''' 
digest was added in 
FreeBSD 6.0. 
Support for file flags was added in 
FreeBSD 4.0, 
and mostly comes from 
NetBSD. 
The 
"full" 
entry format was added by 
NetBSD.
