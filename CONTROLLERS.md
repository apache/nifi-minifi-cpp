### Description

Manages the Amazon Web Services (AWS) ```Access Key``` and ```Secret Access Key``` for a AWS account. This allows for multiple 
AWS credential services to be defined. This also allows for multiple AWS related processors to reference this single 
controller service so that AWS credentials can be managed and controlled in a central location.
