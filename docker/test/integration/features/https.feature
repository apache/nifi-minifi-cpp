Feature: Transfer data from and to MiNiFi using HTTPS

  Background:
    Given the content of "/tmp/output" is monitored


  Scenario: InvokeHTTP to ListenHTTP without an SSLContextService works (no mutual TLS in this case)
    Given a GenerateFlowFile processor with the "Data Format" property set to "Text"
    And the "Unique FlowFiles" property of the GenerateFlowFile processor is set to "false"
    And the "Custom Text" property of the GenerateFlowFile processor is set to "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"
    And a InvokeHTTP processor with the "Remote URL" property set to "https://server-${feature_id}:4430/contentListener"
    And the "HTTP Method" property of the InvokeHTTP processor is set to "POST"
    And the "success" relationship of the GenerateFlowFile processor is connected to the InvokeHTTP

    And a ListenHTTP processor with the "Listening Port" property set to "4430" in a "server" flow
    And the "SSL Certificate" property of the ListenHTTP processor is set to "/tmp/resources/minifi_server.crt"
    And a PutFile processor with the "Directory" property set to "/tmp/output" in the "server" flow
    And the "success" relationship of the ListenHTTP processor is connected to the PutFile

    When both instances start up
    Then a flowfile with the content "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet" is placed in the monitored directory in less than 10s


  Scenario: InvokeHTTP to ListenHTTP without an SSLContextService requires a server cert signed by a CA
    Given a GenerateFlowFile processor with the "Data Format" property set to "Text"
    And the "Unique FlowFiles" property of the GenerateFlowFile processor is set to "false"
    And the "Custom Text" property of the GenerateFlowFile processor is set to "consectetur adipiscing elit"
    And a InvokeHTTP processor with the "Remote URL" property set to "https://server-${feature_id}:4430/contentListener"

    And a ListenHTTP processor with the "Listening Port" property set to "4430" in a "server" flow
    And the "SSL Certificate" property of the ListenHTTP processor is set to "/tmp/resources/self_signed_server.crt"
    And a PutFile processor with the "Directory" property set to "/tmp/output" in the "server" flow
    And the "success" relationship of the ListenHTTP processor is connected to the PutFile

    When both instances start up
    Then no files are placed in the monitored directory in 10s of running time

    And the "SSL Certificate" property of the ListenHTTP processor is set to "/tmp/resources/self_signed_server.crt"
    And a PutFile processor with the "Directory" property set to "/tmp/output" in the "server" flow
    And the "success" relationship of the ListenHTTP processor is connected to the PutFile

    When both instances start up
    Then a flowfile with the content "sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt" is placed in the monitored directory in less than 10s
