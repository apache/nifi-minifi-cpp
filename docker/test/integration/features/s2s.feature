Feature: Sending data from MiNiFi-C++ to NiFi using S2S protocol
  In order to transfer data inbetween NiFi and MiNiFi flows
  As a user of MiNiFi
  I need to have RemoteProcessGroup flow nodes

  Background:
    Given the content of "/tmp/output" is monitored

  Scenario: A MiNiFi instance produces and transfers data to a NiFi instance via s2s
    Given a GetFile processor with the "Input Directory" property set to "/tmp/input"
    And a file with the content "test" is present in "/tmp/input"
    And a RemoteProcessGroup node with name "RemoteProcessGroup" is opened on "http://nifi-${feature_id}:8080/nifi"
    And an input port with name "to_nifi" is created on the RemoteProcessGroup named "RemoteProcessGroup"
    And the "success" relationship of the GetFile processor is connected to the to_nifi

    And a NiFi flow is receiving data from the RemoteProcessGroup named "RemoteProcessGroup" in an input port named "from-minifi" which has the same id as the port named "to_nifi"
    And a PutFile processor with the "Directory" property set to "/tmp/output" in the "nifi" flow
    And the "success" relationship of the from-minifi is connected to the PutFile

    When NiFi is started
    And all instances start up

    Then a flowfile with the content "test" is placed in the monitored directory in less than 90 seconds
    And the Minifi logs do not contain the following message: "ProcessSession rollback" after 1 seconds

  Scenario: A MiNiFi instance produces and transfers a large data file to a NiFi instance via s2s
    Given a GetFile processor with the "Input Directory" property set to "/tmp/input"
    And a file with the content "this is a very long file we want to send by site-to-site" is present in "/tmp/input"
    And a RemoteProcessGroup node with name "RemoteProcessGroup" is opened on "http://nifi-${feature_id}:8080/nifi"
    And an input port with name "to_nifi" is created on the RemoteProcessGroup named "RemoteProcessGroup"
    And the "success" relationship of the GetFile processor is connected to the to_nifi

    And a NiFi flow is receiving data from the RemoteProcessGroup named "RemoteProcessGroup" in an input port named "from-minifi" which has the same id as the port named "to_nifi"
    And a PutFile processor with the "Directory" property set to "/tmp/output" in the "nifi" flow
    And the "success" relationship of the from-minifi is connected to the PutFile

    When NiFi is started
    And all instances start up

    Then a flowfile with the content "this is a very long file we want to send by site-to-site" is placed in the monitored directory in less than 90 seconds
    And the Minifi logs do not contain the following message: "ProcessSession rollback" after 1 seconds

  Scenario: Zero length files are transfered between via s2s if the "drop empty" connection property is false
    Given a MiNiFi CPP server with yaml config
    And a GenerateFlowFile processor with the "File Size" property set to "0B"
    And a RemoteProcessGroup node with name "RemoteProcessGroup" is opened on "http://nifi-${feature_id}:8080/nifi"
    And an input port with name "to_nifi" is created on the RemoteProcessGroup named "RemoteProcessGroup"
    And the "success" relationship of the GenerateFlowFile processor is connected to the to_nifi

    And a NiFi flow is receiving data from the RemoteProcessGroup named "RemoteProcessGroup" in an input port named "from-minifi" which has the same id as the port named "to_nifi"
    And a PutFile processor with the "Directory" property set to "/tmp/output" in the "nifi" flow
    And the "success" relationship of the from-minifi is connected to the PutFile

    When NiFi is started
    And all instances start up

    Then at least one empty flowfile is placed in the monitored directory in less than 90 seconds

  Scenario: Zero length files are not transfered between via s2s if the "drop empty" connection property is true
    # "drop empty" is only supported with yaml config
    Given a MiNiFi CPP server with yaml config
    And a GenerateFlowFile processor with the "File Size" property set to "0B"
    And a RemoteProcessGroup node with name "RemoteProcessGroup" is opened on "http://nifi-${feature_id}:8080/nifi"
    And an input port with name "to_nifi" is created on the RemoteProcessGroup named "RemoteProcessGroup"
    And the "success" relationship of the GenerateFlowFile processor is connected to the to_nifi
    And the connection going to the RemoteProcessGroup has "drop empty" set

    And a NiFi flow is receiving data from the RemoteProcessGroup named "RemoteProcessGroup" in an input port named "from-minifi" which has the same id as the port named "to_nifi"
    And a PutFile processor with the "Directory" property set to "/tmp/output" in the "nifi" flow
    And the "success" relationship of the from-minifi is connected to the PutFile

    When NiFi is started
    And all instances start up

    Then no files are placed in the monitored directory in 50 seconds of running time
