Feature: Sending data to MQTT streaming platform using PublishMQTT
  In order to send and receive data via MQTT
  As a user of MiNiFi
  I need to have PublishMQTT and ConsumeMQTT processors

  Background:
    Given the content of "/tmp/output" is monitored

  Scenario Outline: A MiNiFi instance transfers data to an MQTT broker
    Given a GetFile processor with the "Input Directory" property set to "/tmp/input"
    And a file with the content "test" is present in "/tmp/input"
    And a PublishMQTT processor set up to communicate with an MQTT broker instance
    And the "MQTT Version" property of the PublishMQTT processor is set to "<version>"
    And a PutFile processor with the "Directory" property set to "/tmp/output"
    And the "success" relationship of the GetFile processor is connected to the PublishMQTT
    And the "success" relationship of the PublishMQTT processor is connected to the PutFile

    And an MQTT broker is set up in correspondence with the PublishMQTT

    When both instances start up
    Then a flowfile with the content "test" is placed in the monitored directory in less than 60 seconds
    And the MQTT broker has a log line matching "Received PUBLISH from .*testtopic.*\(4 bytes\)"

    Examples: MQTT versions
    | version  |
    | 3.x AUTO |
    | 5.0      |

  Scenario Outline: If the MQTT broker does not exist, then no flow files are processed
    Given a GetFile processor with the "Input Directory" property set to "/tmp/input"
    And a file with the content "test" is present in "/tmp/input"
    And a PublishMQTT processor set up to communicate with an MQTT broker instance
    And the "MQTT Version" property of the PublishMQTT processor is set to "<version>"
    And a PutFile processor with the "Directory" property set to "/tmp/output"
    And the "success" relationship of the GetFile processor is connected to the PublishMQTT
    And the "success" relationship of the PublishMQTT processor is connected to the PutFile
    And the "failure" relationship of the PublishMQTT processor is connected to the PutFile

    When the MiNiFi instance starts up
    Then no files are placed in the monitored directory in 30 seconds of running time

    Examples: MQTT versions
    | version  |
    | 3.x AUTO |
    | 5.0      |

  Scenario Outline: Verify delivery of message when MQTT broker is unstable
    Given a GetFile processor with the "Input Directory" property set to "/tmp/input"
    And a file with the content "test" is present in "/tmp/input"
    And a PublishMQTT processor set up to communicate with an MQTT broker instance
    And the "MQTT Version" property of the PublishMQTT processor is set to "<version>"
    And a PutFile processor with the "Directory" property set to "/tmp/output"
    And the "success" relationship of the GetFile processor is connected to the PublishMQTT
    And the "success" relationship of the PublishMQTT processor is connected to the PutFile

    When the MiNiFi instance starts up
    Then no files are placed in the monitored directory in 10 seconds of running time

    When an MQTT broker is set up in correspondence with the PublishMQTT
    Then a flowfile with the content "test" is placed in the monitored directory in less than 60 seconds
    And the MQTT broker has a log line matching "Received PUBLISH from .*testtopic.*\(4 bytes\)"

    Examples: MQTT versions
    | version  |
    | 3.x AUTO |
    | 5.0      |

  Scenario Outline: A MiNiFi instance publishes and consumes data to/from an MQTT broker
    Given a GetFile processor with the "Input Directory" property set to "/tmp/input"
    And a PublishMQTT processor set up to communicate with an MQTT broker instance
    And the "MQTT Version" property of the PublishMQTT processor is set to "<version>"

    And a PutFile processor with the "Directory" property set to "/tmp/output"
    And "ConsumeMQTT" processor is a start node
    And the "success" relationship of the ConsumeMQTT processor is connected to the PutFile

    And an MQTT broker is set up in correspondence with the PublishMQTT and ConsumeMQTT

    When both instances start up
    Then the MQTT broker has a log line matching "Received SUBSCRIBE from consumer-client"
    And the MQTT broker has a log line matching "New client connected from .* as publisher-client"
    And a file with the content "test" is placed in "/tmp/input"
    And a flowfile with the content "test" is placed in the monitored directory in less than 60 seconds
    And the MQTT broker has a log line matching "Received PUBLISH from .*testtopic.*\(4 bytes\)"

    | 3.x AUTO |
    | 3.1.0    |
    | 3.1.1    |
    | 5.0      |
