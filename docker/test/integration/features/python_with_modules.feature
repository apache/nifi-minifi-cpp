Feature: MiNiFi can use python modules
  Background:
    Given the content of "/tmp/output" is monitored

  Scenario: MiNiFi can use python modules
    Given a GaussianDistributionWithNumpy processor
    And the scheduling period of the GaussianDistributionWithNumpy processor is set to "10 min"
    And a PutFile processor with the "Directory" property set to "/tmp/output"
    And the "success" relationship of the GaussianDistributionWithNumpy processor is connected to the PutFile

    When the MiNiFi instance starts up
    Then 1 flowfile is placed in the monitored directory in 20 seconds
