## Description

Apache NiFi MiNiFi C++ can communicates with a C2 Server via a number of protocols. These protocols
deliver a C2 response the server, expecting requests in a heartbeat response. The protocol transforms 
the C2 messages into a protocol specific representation. The internal representation is an AST therefore 
you must define the root classes, which configure the classes that branch from the root. You can define 
arbitrary nodes and sub-trees, but this isn't necessary and only advantageous for custom C2 servers. That 
will be explained in greater detail in the metrics section.

## Configuration

### Base Options
For more more insight into the API used within the C2 agent, please visit:
https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MINIFI/C2+Design+Proposal

Release 0.6.0: Please note that all c2 properties now exist as `nifi.c2.*`. If your configuration properties
files contain the former naming convention of `c2.*`, we will continue to support that as
an alternate key, but you are encouraged to switch your configuration options as soon as possible.

Note: In release 0.8.0 there is a configuration option to minimize the heartbeat payload size by excluding agent manifest.
For that, add "nifi.c2.full.heartbeat"=false property.
With this change, heartbeat with agent manifest included is sent only for the first time then falls back to sending
light weight heartbeat. If for some reason the C2 server does not receive the first full heartbeat, the manifest can
be requested via C2 DESCRIBE manifest command.

	#in minifi.properties

	# Disable/Enable C2
	nifi.c2.enable=true

	# specify classes for the AST response
	nifi.c2.root.classes=DeviceInfoNode,AgentInformation,FlowInformation
	
	# specify C2 protocol -- default is CoapProtocol if not specified
	#nifi.c2.agent.protocol.class=CoapProtocol
	# may also use MQTT or REST
	# nifi.c2.agent.protocol.class=MQTTC2Protocol
	nifi.c2.agent.protocol.class=RESTSender
	
	# control c2 heartbeat interval in millisecocnds
	nifi.c2.agent.heartbeat.period=250
	
	# enable reporter classes
	nifi.c2.agent.heartbeat.reporter.class=RESTReciver
	
	# specify the rest URIs if using RESTSender
	nifi.c2.rest.url=http://<your-c2-server>/<c2-api-path>/c2-protocol/heartbeat
	nifi.c2.rest.url.ack=http://<your-c2-server>/<c2-api-path>/c2-protocol/acknowledge
	nifi.c2.flow.base.url=http://<your-c2-server>/<c2-api-path>/c2-protocol/
	
	# c2 agent identifier -- must be defined to run agent
	nifi.c2.agent.identifier=<your identifier>
	
	# c2 agent class -- must be defined to run agent
	nifi.c2.agent.class=<your agent class>
	
	# configure SSL Context service for REST Protocol
	#nifi.c2.rest.ssl.context.service


### Metrics

Command and Control metrics can be used to send metrics through the heartbeat or via the DESCRIBE
operation. Since responses are formed in an AST, metrics can be formed as a sub tree. Metrics classes
are defined apriori and may reference a metrics class specific to a processor. The following example describes
a configuration of an agent

	# in minifi.properties
 	
	
	nifi.c2.root.class.definitions=metrics
	nifi.c2.root.class.definitions.metrics.name=metrics
	nifi.c2.root.class.definitions.metrics.metrics=typedmetrics,processorMetrics
	nifi.c2.root.class.definitions.metrics.metrics.typedmetrics.name=RuntimeMetrics
	nifi.c2.root.class.definitions.metrics.metrics.typedmetrics.classes=ProcessMetrics,SystemInformation
	nifi.c2.root.class.definitions.metrics.metrics.processorMetrics.name=ProcessorMetrics
	nifi.c2.root.class.definitions.metrics.metrics.processorMetrics.classes=GetFileMetrics
	
This example shows a metrics sub tree defined by the option 'nifi.c2.root.class.definitions'.

This is a comma separated list of all sub trees. In the example, above, only one sub tree exists: metrics.

The options below metrics define the sub-trees within metrics: typedmetrics and processorMetrics. Each of these has a name.
The classes sub option will define the metrics classes that are placed within this sub-tree. For the RESTProtocol, the above 
configuration produces the following JSON:

	"metrics": {
        "ProcessorMetrics": {
            "GetFileMetrics": {
                "AcceptedFiles": 22,
                "InputBytes": 61755,
                "OnTriggerInvocations": 1
            }
        },
        "RuntimeMetrics": {
            "ProcessMetrics": {
                "CpuMetrics": {
                    "involcs": 1
                },
                "MemoryMetrics": {
                    "maxrss": 145804
                }
            },
            "systeminfo": {
                "systemInfo": {
                    "machinearch": "x86_64",
                    "physicalMem": 67361411072,
                    "vCores": 12
                },
                "identifier": "identifier"
            }
        }
    }
    

### Protocols

The default protocol is a RESTFul service; however, there is an MQTT protocol with a translation to use the 
RESTFul C2 server and a CoAP Protocol implementation. The CoAP protocol requires that COAP be enabled either
through the bootstrap or the cmake flag -DENABLE_COAP=ON .

Once configured, COAP uses a controller service within the flow OR minifi properties entries: nifi.c2.agent.coap.host and nifi.c2.agent.coap.port.
Note that with CoAP, the payload will be significantly smaller, paring down metrics that are sent in each heartbeat. This will be useful for
constrained environments. 

	nifi.c2.agent.coap.host=hostname
	nifi.c2.agent.coap.port=<port number>
   
   
If you wish to use the Controller service you made add a controller service named CoapConnectorService with the properties in the example config
below. Note that Max Queue Size is the only non-required property:

	Controller Services:
	- id: 94491a38-015a-1000-0000-000000000001
	  name: coapservice
	  class: CoapConnectorService
	  Properties:
	    Remote Server: server
	    Remote Port: port
	    Max Queue Size: 1000

As defined, above, MQTTC2Protocol can be used for the agent protocol class. If you wish to communicate with a RESTFul C2 server,
you may use the ConvertBase, ConvertHeartBeat, ConvertJSONAack, and ConvertUpdate classes on an agent to perform the translation.
State is not kept with an intermediate agent other than the broker. The broker is not embedded with the agent to simplify the agent.

An example configuration, below, defines an agent that receives and forward MQTT C2 requests to a C2 server. Additionally, this agent
will forward responses and updates to the heartbeating agents.

### UpdatePolicies

Updates to MiNiFi C++ properties can be controlled through an UpdatePolicyControllerService named
C2UpdatePolicy. The service supports several configuration options. They are defined in the following example:   

	
	Controller Services:
	- id: 94491a38-015a-1000-0000-000000000001
	  name: C2UpdatePolicy
	  class: UpdatePolicyControllerService
	  Properties:
	    # true enables all properties to be updated. 
	    Allow All Properties: true
	    # allowed properties are those which can be updated
	    Allowed Properties: 
	             Property_1:true
	             Property_2:true
	    Disallowed Properties:
	    		 Property_3:true
	             Property_4:true
	
 	
### Triggers
  
  C2 Triggers can be activated to perform some C2 activity via a local event. Currently only FileUpdateTrigger exists, which monitors
  for C2 File triggers to update the flow configuration. Classes can be defined as a comma separated list of classes to load via the option
  nifi.c2.agent.trigger.classes
  
  
#### C2 File triggers

C2 updates can be triggered with updates to a flow configuration file. It doesn't have to be the same base configuration file. It
will be copied into place. A new property, nifi.c2.file.watch, can be placed into minifi.properties to monitor. If the update time
changes while the agent is running, it will be copied into place of the file defined by nifi.flow.configuration.file. The agent
will then be restarted with the new flow configuration. If a failure occurs in reading that file or it is an invalid YAML file, the 
update process will be halted.

    in minifi.properties to activate the file update trigger specify

	# specifying a trigger
	nifi.c2.agent.trigger.classes=FileUpdateTrigger
	nifi.c2.file.watch=<full path of file to monitor>
	

	
## Documentation

Type descriptions ( class descriptions entered in PROCESSORS.md ) can be automatically placed within C2 by building cmake with
the following flag:

	cmake -DBOOTSTRAP=ON .. 
	
	You can then run ./extensions/bootstrap/bstrp --inputc2docs <PROCESSORS.md> --outputc2docs ../libminifi/include/agent/agent_docs.h
	
 When cmake is instantiated with this, a build will re-generate the type descriptions from PROCESSORS.md. Once this is finished
 you may re-build the project with the following command from the build directory, running the build as you normally would: 

	cmake -DBOOTSTRAP= ..
