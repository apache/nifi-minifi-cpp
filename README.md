## Features

Apache NiFi - MiNiFi C++ is a complementary data collection approach that supplements the core tenets of [NiFi](http://nifi.apache.org/) in dataflow management, focusing on the collection of data at the source of its creation.  The C++ implementation is an additional implementation to the one in Java with the aim of an even smaller resource footprint.

Specific goals for MiNiFi comprise:
- small and lightweight footprint
- central management of agents
- generation of data provenance
- integration with NiFi for follow-on dataflow management and full chain of custody of information

Perspectives of the role of MiNiFi should be from the perspective of the agent acting immediately at, or directly adjacent to, source sensors, systems, or servers.

### Expression Language

A subset of the Apache NiFi [Expression Language](EXPRESSIONS.md) is supported.


### Processors

MiNiFi - C++ supports the following C++ processors:

The following table lists the base set of processors.

The next table outlines CMAKE flags that correspond with MiNiFi extensions. Extensions that are enabled by default ( such as CURL ), can be disabled with the respective CMAKE flag on the command line.

Through JNI extensions you can run NiFi processors using NARs. The JNI extension set allows you to run these Java processors. MiNiFi C++ will favor C++ implementations over Java implements. In the case where a processor is implemented in either language, the one in C++ will be selected; however, will remain transparent to the consumer.

 Please see our [Python guide](extensions/script/README.md) on how to write Python processors and use them within MiNiFi C++.

## Caveats
* We follow semver with regards to API compatibility, but no ABI compatibility is provided. See [semver's website](https://semver.org/) for more information
* Build and usage currently only supports Windows, Linux and OS X environments. MiNiFi C++ can be built and run through the Windows Subsystem for Linux but we provide no support for this platform.
* Provenance events generation is supported and are persisted using RocksDB. Volatile repositories can be used on systems without persistent storage.
* If MiNiFi C++ is built with the OPC-UA extension enabled, it bundles [open62541](https://open62541.org/), which is available under the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0, a Category B license under [ASF 3rd party license policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-b).
* If MiNiFi C++ packaged on Windows, the resulting MSI may not be publicly redistributed under the Apache license, because it contains Microsoft redistributable DLLs, which fall under Category X of the [ASF 3rd party license policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).

## System Requirements

### To build

#### Utilities
* CMake 3.17 or greater
* gcc 10 or greater
* bison 3.0.x+ (3.2 has been shown to fail builds)
* flex 2.6 or greater

##### External Projects

The following utilities are needed to build external projects, when bundled
versions of LibreSSL, cURL, or zlib are used:

* patch
* autoconf
* automake
* libtool

**NOTE** if Expression Language support is enabled, FlexLexer must be in the include path and the version must be compatible with the version of flex used when generating lexer sources. On Mac OS X and FreeBSD, make sure that the system version is overridden with the correct flex version, which may require merging your CPPFLAGS into CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS. Lexer source generation is automatically performed during CMake builds. To re-generate the sources, remove:

 * extensions/expression-language/Parser.cpp
 * extensions/expression-language/Parser.hpp
 * extensions/expression-language/Scanner.cpp
 * extensions/expression-language/location.hh
 * extensions/expression-language/position.hh
 * extensions/expression-language/stack.hh

and rebuild.

#### Libraries / Development Headers
* libcurl-openssl (If not available or desired, NSS will be used)
* libuuid and uuid-dev
* openssl
* Python 3 and development headers -- Required, unless Python support is disabled
* Lua and development headers -- Optional, unless Lua support is enabled
* libgps-dev -- Required if building libGPS support
* Zlib headers

#### CentOS 7

Additional environmental preparations are required for CentOS 7 support. Before
building, install and enable the devtoolset-10 SCL:

```
$ sudo yum install centos-release-scl
$ sudo yum install devtoolset-10
$ scl enable devtoolset-10 bash
```

Finally, it is required to add the `-lrt` compiler flag by using the
`-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-lrt` flag when invoking cmake.

On all distributions please use -DUSE_SHARED_LIBS=OFF to statically link zlib, libcurl, and OpenSSL.

#### Windows
  Build and Installation has been tested with Windows 10 using Visual Studio 2019.
  You can build and create an MSI via the CPACK command. This requires the installation of the WiX
  toolset (http://wixtoolset.org/). To do this, open up a prompt into your build directory and
  type 'cpack' . The CPACK command will automatically generate and provide you a path to the distributable
  msi file. See [Windows.md](Windows.md) for more details.

### To run

#### Libraries
* libuuid
* librocksdb (built and statically linked)
* libcurl-openssl (If not available or desired, NSS will be used)
* libssl and libcrypto from libressl (built and statically linked)
* libarchive (built and statically linked)
* librdkafka (built and statically linked)
* Python 3 -- Required, unless Python support is disabled
* Lua -- Optional, unless Lua support is enabled
* libusb -- Optional, unless USB Camera support is enabled
* libpng -- Optional, unless USB Camera support is enabled
* libpcap -- Optional, unless ENABLE_PCAP specified

The needed dependencies can be installed with the following commands for:

##### rpm-based Linux Distributions

## Getting Started

### Bootstrapping

- MiNiFi C++ offers a bootstrap script in the root of our github repo that will bootstrap the cmake and build process for you without the need to install dependencies yourself. To use this
  process, please run the command `bootstrap.sh` from the root of the MiNiFi C++ source tree.

- Per the table, below, you will be presented with a menu guided bootstrap process. You may enable and disable extensions ( further defined below ). Once you are finished selecting the features
  you wish to build, enter P to continue with the process. CMAKE dependencies will be resolved for your distro. You may enter command line options -n to force yes to all prompts
  (including the package installation prompts ) and -b to automatically run make once the cmake process is complete. Alternatively, you may include the package argument to bootstrap, -p,
  which will run make package.

- If you provide -b or -p to bootstrap.sh, you do not need to follow the Building section, below. If you do not provide these arguments you may skip the cmake .. section from Building.

- Using the Release build profile is recommended to reduce binary size. (~200 MB vs ~30 MB)

  ```
  # ~/Development/code/apache/nifi-minifi-cpp on git:master
  $ ./bootstrap.sh
  # CMAKE Build dir exists, should we overwrite your build directory before we begin?
    If you have already bootstrapped, bootstrapping again isn't necessary to run make [ Y/N ] Y

- Bootstrap now saves state between runs. State will automatically be saved. Provide -c or --clear to clear this state. The -i option provides a guided menu install with the ability to change
advanced features.

### Building

- From your source checkout, create a directory to perform the build (e.g. build) and cd into that directory.
  ```
  # ~/Development/code/apache/nifi-minifi-cpp on git:master
  $ mkdir build
  # ~/Development/code/apache/nifi-minifi-cpp on git:master
  $ cd build
  ```

- Perform a `cmake ..` to generate the project files
  - Optionally disable or enable extensions. Please visit our guide [extensions guide](Extensions.md) for flags or our wiki entry on
    [customizing builds](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=74685143) for more information on this topic.

  CPack: Create package
  CPack: - package: ~/Development/code/apache/nifi-minifi-cpp/build/nifi-minifi-cpp-0.12.0-source.tar.gz generated.
  ```

### Building a docker image

#### Building your own custom image
You can create a custom docker image using the cmake configuration to specify which extensions should be included in the final image. Use `-DDOCKER_BUILD_ONLY=ON` to skip local environment checks of cmake.
```
~/Development/code/apache/nifi-minifi-cpp/build
$ cmake -DENABLE_JNI=OFF -DENABLE_AWS=ON -DENABLE_LIBRDKAFKA=ON -DENABLE_MQTT=ON -DENABLE_AZURE=ON -DENABLE_SQL=ON -DDOCKER_BUILD_ONLY=ON ..
$ make docker
```

#### Building the minimal/cloud image
There is also on option to build the minimal image which only contains the most common extensions used in cloud environments. That image includes the standard MiNiFi processors and the AWS, Azure and Kafka extensions. This is also the image which is released to the [apache/nifi-minifi-cpp](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/nifi-minifi-cpp) repository on dockerhub.
```
~/Development/code/apache/nifi-minifi-cpp/build
$ cmake -DDOCKER_BUILD_ONLY=ON ..
$ make docker-minimal
```

#### Executing integration tests with your docker image
You can execute system integration tests using the docker image built locally on a docker daemon running locally. The image shall contain every extension tested in the test suite for all scenarios to be executed (currently that includes AWS, Azure, Kafka, MQTT, SQL extensions).
```
~/Development/code/apache/nifi-minifi-cpp/build
$ make docker-verify
```

### Building For Other Distros
If you have docker installed on your machine you can build for CentOS 7, Fedora 34, Ubuntu 18.04, and Ubuntu 20.04 via our make docker commands. The following table
provides the command to build your distro and the output file in your build directory. Since the versions are limited ( except for Ubuntu ) we output the archive based on the distro's name.


| Distro                | command     | Output File                            |
|-----------------------|:------------|:---------------------------------------|
| CentOS 7              | make centos | nifi-minifi-cpp-centos-$VERSION.tar.gz |
| Fedora 34             | make fedora | nifi-minifi-cpp-fedora-$VERSION.tar.gz |
| Ubuntu 18.04 (bionic) | make u18    | nifi-minifi-cpp-bionic-$VERSION.tar.gz |
| Ubuntu 20.04 (focal)  | make u20    | nifi-minifi-cpp-focal-$VERSION.tar.gz  |

You can avoid the requirement of an up-to-date compiler when generating the build system by adding `-DDOCKER_BUILD_ONLY=ON` to the cmake command line. This disables all cmake targets except the docker build and test ones.

### Installation
After [building](#building) MiNiFi C++, extract the generated binary package 'nifi-minifi-cpp-$VERSION.tar.gz' at your desired installation path.
```shell
$ MINIFI_PACKAGE="$(pwd)"/build/nifi-minifi-cpp-*.tar.gz
$ pushd /opt
$ sudo tar xvzf "$MINIFI_PACKAGE"
$ cd nifi-minifi-cpp-*
```

### Configuring
The 'conf' directory in the installation root contains a template config.yml document, minifi.properties, and minifi-log.properties. Please see our [Configuration document](CONFIGURE.md) for details on how to configure agents.

### Running
After completing the [installation](#installation), the application can be run by issuing the following command from the installation directory:

    $ ./bin/minifi.sh start

By default, this will make use of a config.yml located in the conf directory.  This configuration file location can be altered by adjusting the property `nifi.flow.configuration.file` in minifi.properties located in the conf directory.

### Stopping

MiNiFi can then be stopped by issuing:

    $ ./bin/minifi.sh stop

### Installing as a service

MiNiFi can also be installed as a system service using minifi.sh with an optional "service name" (default: minifi)

    $ ./bin/minifi.sh install [service name]

### Running as a docker container
You can use the officially released image pulled from the [apache/nifi-minifi-cpp](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/nifi-minifi-cpp) repository on dockerhub or you can use your locally built image.
The container can be run with a specific configuration by mounting the locally edited configuration files to your docker container.
```
$ docker run -v ~/Development/apache/nifi-minifi-cpp/conf/config.yml:/opt/minifi/minifi-current/conf/config.yml -v ~/Development/apache/nifi-minifi-cpp/conf/minifi.properties:/opt/minifi/minifi-current/conf/minifi.properties apache/nifi-minifi-cpp
```

### Deploying
MiNiFi C++ comes with a deployment script. This will build and package minifi. Additionally, a file named build_output will be
created within the build directory that contains a manifest of build artifacts.

    $ deploy.sh <build identifier>

The build identifier will be carried with the deployed binary for the configuration you specify. By default all extensions will be built.

On Windows it is suggested that MSI be used for installation.

### Cleaning
Remove the build directory created above.
```
# ~/Development/code/apache/nifi-minifi-cpp on git:master
$ rm -rf ./build
```


### Extensions

### Security

For securing a MiNiFi agent's configuration files it comes with a tool called `encrypt-config`. Its documentation is available [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MINIFI/Securing+MiNiFi+configuration+files).

### Recommended Antivirus Exclusions

Antivirus software can take a long time to scan directories and the files within them. Additionally, if the antivirus software locks files or directories during a scan, those resources are unavailable to MiNiFi processes, causing latency or unavailability of these resources in a MiNiFi instance. To prevent these performance and reliability issues from occurring, it is highly recommended to configure your antivirus software to skip scans on the following MiNiFi C++ directories:

- content_repository
- flowfile_repository
- provenance_repository
