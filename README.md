## Features

Apache NiFi - MiNiFi C++ is a complementary data collection approach that supplements the core tenets of [NiFi](http://nifi.apache.org/) in dataflow management, focusing on the collection of data at the source of its creation.  The C++ implementation is an additional implementation to the one in Java with the aim of an even smaller resource footprint.

Specific goals for MiNiFi comprise:
- small and lightweight footprint
- central management of agents
- generation of data provenance
- integration with NiFi for follow-on dataflow management and full chain of custody of information

Perspectives of the role of MiNiFi should be from the perspective of the agent acting immediately at, or directly adjacent to, source sensors, systems, or servers.

### Expression Language

A subset of the Apache NiFi [Expression Language](EXPRESSIONS.md) is supported.

### Processors

MiNiFi - C++ supports the following processors:

* [AppendHostInfo](PROCESSORS.md#appendhostinfo)
* [ApplyTemplate](PROCESSORS.md#applytemplate)
* [CompressContent](PROCESSORS.md#compresscontent)
* [ConsumeMQTT](PROCESSORS.md#consumeMQTT)

## Caveats
* 0.5.0 represents a GA-release. We follow semver so you can expect API and ABI compatibility within minor releases. See [semver's website](https://semver.org/) for more information
* Build and usage currently only supports Linux and OS X environments. MiNiFi C++ can be built and run through the Windows Subsystem for Linux but we provide no support for this platform.
* Provenance events generation is supported and are persisted using RocksDB. Volatile repositories can be used on systems without persistent storage.

## System Requirements

### To build

#### Utilities
* CMake
  * 3.1 or greater
* gcc
  * 4.8.4 or greater
* g++
  * 4.8.4 or greater
* bison
  * 3.0 or greater
* flex
  * 2.5 or greater

##### External Projects

The following utilities are needed to build external projects, when bundled
versions of LibreSSL, cURL, or zlib are used:

* patch 
* autoconf 
* automake 
* libtool 
  
**NOTE** if Lua support is enabled, then a C++ compiler with support for c++-14 must be used. If using GCC, version 6.x
or greater is recommended.

#### Libraries / Development Headers
* libboost and boost-devel
  * 1.48.0 or greater
* libcurl-openssl (If not available or desired, NSS will be used by applying -DUSE_CURL_NSS)
* librocksdb4.1 and librocksdb-dev
* libuuid and uuid-dev
* openssl
* Python 3 and development headers -- Required, unless Python support is disabled
* Lua and development headers -- Optional, unless Lua support is enabled
* libgps-dev -- Required if building libGPS support

** NOTE: IF ROCKSDB IS NOT INSTALLED, IT WILL BE BUILT FROM THE THIRD PARTY
DIRECTORY UNLESS YOU SPECIFY -DDISABLE_ROCKSDB=true WITH CMAKE ***

#### CentOS 6

Additional environmental preparations are required for CentOS 6 support. Before
building, install and enable the devtoolset-6 SCL:

```
$ sudo yum install centos-release-scl
$ sudo yum install devtoolset-6
$ scl enable devtoolset-6 bash
```

Additionally, for expression language support, it is recommended to install GNU
Bison 3.x:

```
$ wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bison/bison-3.0.4.tar.xz
$ tar xvf bison-3.0.4.tar.xz
$ cd bison-3.0.4
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

Finally, it is required to add the `-lrt` compiler flag by using the
`-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-lrt` flag when invoking cmake.

#### SLES
  SLES 11 requires manual installation of the SDK using the following link:
    https://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7015337
  Once these are installed you will need to download and build CMAKE3, OpenSSL1.0,
  and Python3. Once these are installed follow the cmake procedures. The bootstrap
  script will not work.

  SLES 12 requires you to enable the SDK module in YAST. It is advised that you use
  the bootstrap script to help guide installation. Please see the Bootstrapping section
  below.

### To run

#### Libraries
* libuuid
* librocksdb *** IF NOT INSTALLED, WILL BE BUILT FROM THIRD PARTY DIRECTORY ***
* libcurl-openssl (If not available or desired, NSS will be used by applying -DUSE_CURL_NSS)
* libssl and libcrypto from openssl 
* libarchive
* librdkafka
* Python 3 -- Required, unless Python support is disabled
* Lua -- Optional, unless Lua support is enabled
* libusb -- Optional, unless USB Camera support is enabled
* libpng -- Optional, unless USB Camera support is enabled
* libpcap -- Optional, unless ENABLE_PCAP specified

The needed dependencies can be installed with the following commands for:

##### Yum based Linux Distributions

**NOTE** if a newer compiler is required, such as when Lua support is enabled, it is recommended to use a newer compiler
using a devtools-* package from the Software Collections (SCL).

## Getting Started

### Bootstrapping

- MiNiFi C++ offers a bootstrap script in the root of our github repo that will boot strap the cmake and build process for you without the need to install dependencies yourself. To use this process, please run the command boostrap.sh from the root of the MiNiFi C++ source tree.


- Per the table, below, you will be presented with a menu guided bootstrap process. You may enable and disable extensions ( further defined below ). Once you are finished selecting the features you wish to build, enter N to continue with the process. CMAKE dependencies will be resolved for your distro. You may enter command line options -n to force yes to all prompts ( including the package installation prompts ) and -b to automatically run make once the cmake process is complete. Alternatively, you may include the package argument to boostrap, -p, which will run make package.

- If you provide -b or -p to bootstrap.sh, you do not need to follow the Building section, below. If you do not provide these arguments you may skip the cmake .. section from Building.

  ```
  # ~/Development/code/apache/nifi-minifi-cpp on git:master
  $ ./bootstrap.sh
  # CMAKE Build dir exists, should we overwrite your build directory before we begin?
    If you have already bootstrapped, bootstrapping again isn't necessary to run make [ Y/N ] Y

### Cleaning
Remove the build directory created above.
```
# ~/Development/code/apache/nifi-minifi-cpp on git:master
$ rm -rf ./build
```

### Configuring
The 'conf' directory in the root contains a template config.yml document.  

This is compatible with the format used with the Java MiNiFi application.  Currently, a subset of the configuration is supported and MiNiFi C++ is currently compatible with version 1 of the MiNiFi YAML schema.
Additional information on the YAML format for the config.yml and schema versioning can be found in the [MiNiFi System Administrator Guide](https://nifi.apache.org/minifi/system-admin-guide.html).

Additionally, users can utilize the MiNiFi Toolkit Converter (version 0.0.1 - schema version 1) to aid in creating a flow configuration from a generated template exported from a NiFi instance.  The MiNiFi Toolkit Converter tool can be downloaded from http://nifi.apache.org/minifi/download.html under the `MiNiFi Toolkit Binaries` section.  Information on its usage is available at https://nifi.apache.org/minifi/minifi-toolkit.html.

### SiteToSite Security Configuration

    in minifi.properties

    enable tls
    nifi.remote.input.secure=true

    if you want to enable client certificate base authorization
    nifi.security.need.ClientAuth=true
    setup the client certificate and private key PEM files
    nifi.security.client.certificate=./conf/client.pem
    nifi.security.client.private.key=./conf/client.pem
    setup the client private key passphrase file
    nifi.security.client.pass.phrase=./conf/password
    setup the client CA certificate file
    nifi.security.client.ca.certificate=./conf/nifi-cert.pem

    if you do not want to enable client certificate base authorization
    nifi.security.need.ClientAuth=false
  
You have the option of specifying an SSL Context Service definition for the RPGs instead of the properties above. 
This will link to a corresponding SSL Context service defined in the flow. 
    
To do this specify the SSL Context Service Property in your RPGs and link it to 
a defined controller service. If you do not take this approach the options, above, will be used
for TCP and secure HTTPS communications.

      proxy password:

### Command and Control Configuration
Please see the [C2 readme](C2.md) for more informatoin 
	
	
### Configuring Repository storage locations
Persistent repositories, such as the Flow File repository, use a configurable path to store data. 
The repository locations and their defaults are defined below. By default the MINIFI_HOME env
variable is used. If this is not specified we extrapolate the path and use the root installation
folder. You may specify your own path in place of these defaults. 
     
     in minifi.properties
     nifi.provenance.repository.directory.default=${MINIFI_HOME}/provenance_repository
     nifi.flowfile.repository.directory.default=${MINIFI_HOME}/flowfile_repository
	 nifi.database.content.repository.directory.default=${MINIFI_HOME}/content_repository

### Configuring Volatile and NO-OP Repositories
Each of the repositories can be configured to be volatile ( state kept in memory and flushed
 upon restart ) or persistent. Currently, the flow file and provenance repositories can persist
 to RocksDB. The content repository will persist to the local file system if a volatile repo
 is not configured.

 To configure the repositories:

     in minifi.properties
     # For Volatile Repositories:
     nifi.flowfile.repository.class.name=VolatileFlowFileRepository
     nifi.provenance.repository.class.name=VolatileProvenanceRepository
     nifi.content.repository.class.name=VolatileContentRepository

     # configuration options
     # maximum number of entries to keep in memory
     nifi.volatile.repository.options.flowfile.max.count=10000
     # maximum number of bytes to keep in memory, also limited by option above
     nifi.volatile.repository.options.flowfile.max.bytes=1M

     # maximum number of entries to keep in memory
     nifi.volatile.repository.options.provenance.max.count=10000
     # maximum number of bytes to keep in memory, also limited by option above
     nifi.volatile.repository.options.provenance.max.bytes=1M

     # maximum number of entries to keep in memory
     nifi.volatile.repository.options.content.max.count=100000
     # maximum number of bytes to keep in memory, also limited by option above
     nifi.volatile.repository.options.content.max.bytes=1M
     # limits locking for the content repository
     nifi.volatile.repository.options.content.minimal.locking=true
     
     # For NO-OP Repositories:
	 nifi.flowfile.repository.class.name=NoOpRepository
     nifi.provenance.repository.class.name=NoOpRepository

 #### Caveats
 Systems that have limited memory must be cognizant of the options above. Limiting the max count for the number of entries limits memory consumption but also limits the number of events that can be stored. If you are limiting the amount of volatile content you are configuring, you may have excessive session rollback due to invalid stream errors that occur when a claim cannot be found.

 The content repository has a default option for "minimal.locking" set to true. This will attempt to use lock free structures. This may or may not be optimal as this requires additional additional searching of the underlying vector. This may be optimal for cases where max.count is not excessively high. In cases where object permanence is low within the repositories, minimal locking will result in better performance. If there are many processors and/or timing is such that the content repository fills up quickly, performance may be reduced. In all cases a locking cache is used to avoid the worst case complexity of O(n) for the content repository; however, this caching is more heavily used when "minimal.locking" is set to false.

### Provenance Reporter

    Add Provenance Reporting to config.yml
    Provenance Reporting:
      scheduling strategy: TIMER_DRIVEN
      scheduling period: 1 sec
      url: http://localhost:8080/nifi
      port uuid: 471deef6-2a6e-4a7d-912a-81cc17e3a204
      batch size: 100

### REST API access

    Configure REST API user name and password
    nifi.rest.api.user.name=admin
    nifi.rest.api.password=password

    if you want to enable client certificate
    nifi.https.need.ClientAuth=true
    nifi.https.client.certificate=./conf/client.pem
    nifi.https.client.private.key=./conf/client.key
    nifi.https.client.pass.phrase=./conf/password
    nifi.https.client.ca.certificate=./conf/nifi-cert.pem

### UID generation

MiNiFi needs to generate many unique identifiers in the course of operations.  There are a few different uid implementations available that can be configured in minifi-uid.properties.

Implementation for uid generation can be selected using the uid.implementation property values:
1. time - use uuid_generate_time (default option if the file or property value is missing or invalid)
2. random - use uuid_generate_random
3. uuid_default - use uuid_generate (will attempt to use uuid_generate_random and fall back to uuid_generate_time if no high quality randomness is available)
4. minifi_uid - use custom uid algorthim

If minifi_uuid is selected MiNiFi will use a custom uid algorthim consisting of first N bits device identifier, second M bits as bottom portion of a timestamp where N + M = 64, the last 64 bits is an atomic incrementor.

This is faster than the random uuid generator and encodes the device id and a timestamp into every value, making tracing of flowfiles, etc easier.

It does require more configuration.  uid.minifi.device.segment.bits is used to specify how many bits at the beginning to reserve for the device identifier.  It also puts a limit on how many distinct devices can be used.  With the default of 16 bits, there are a maximum of 65,535 unique device identifiers that can be used.  The 48 bit timestamp won't repeat for almost 9,000 years.  With 24 bits for the device identifier, there are a maximum of 16,777,215 unique device identifiers and the 40 bit timestamp won't repeat for about 35 years.

Additionally, a unique hexadecimal uid.minifi.device.segment should be assigned to each MiNiFi instance.

### Controller Services
 If you need to reference a controller service in your config.yml file, use the following template. In the example, below, ControllerServiceClass is the name of the class defining the controller Service. ControllerService1
 is linked to ControllerService2, and requires the latter to be started for ControllerService1 to start.

	Controller Services:
      - name: ControllerService1
 	    id: 2438e3c8-015a-1000-79ca-83af40ec1974
	  	class: ControllerServiceClass
	  	Properties:
	      Property one: value
	      Linked Services:
	        - value: ControllerService2
	  - name: ControllerService2
	    id: 2438e3c8-015a-1000-79ca-83af40ec1992
	  	class: ControllerServiceClass
	  	Properties:

### Linux Power Manager Controller Service
  The linux power manager controller service can be configured to monitor the battery level and status ( discharging or charging ) via the following configuration.
  Simply provide the capacity path and status path along with your threshold for the trigger and low battery alarm and you can monitor your battery and throttle
  the threadpools within MiNiFi C++. Note that the name is identified must be ThreadPoolManager.

    Controller Services:
    - name: ThreadPoolManager
      id: 2438e3c8-015a-1000-79ca-83af40ec1888
      class: LinuxPowerManagerService
      Properties:
          Battery Capacity Path: /path/to/battery/capacity
          Battery Status Path: /path/to/battery/status
          Trigger Threshold: 90
          Low Battery Threshold: 50
          Wait Period: 500 ms
          
### MQTT Controller service
The MQTTController Service can be configured for MQTT connectivity and provide that capability to your processors when MQTT is built.
    
    Controller Services:
    - name: mqttservice
      id: 294491a38-015a-1000-0000-000000000001
      class: MQTTContextService
      Properties:
          Broker URI: localhost:1883
    	    Client ID: client ID
          Quality of Service: 2
          
### Network Prioritizer Controller Service
  The network prioritizer controller service can be configured to manage prioritizing and binding to specific network interfaces. Linked Services, can be used
  as a prioritized list to create a disjunction among multiple networking prioritizers. This allows you to create classes with different configurations that
  create multiple prioritizations. Max Throughput is the maximum throughput in bytes per second. Max Payload is the maximum number of bytes supported by that
  prioritizer. If a prioritizer is configured with the option "Default Prioritizer: true," then all socket communications will use that default prioritizer.
  
  In the configuration below there are two classes defined under "NetworkPrioritizerService", one class "NetworkPrioritizerService2" defines en0, and en1.
  If en0 is down at any point, then en1 will be given priority before resorting to en2 and en3 of  "NetworkPrioritizerService3". If the throughput for 
  "NetworkPrioritizerService2" exceeds the defined throughput or the max payload of 1024, then "NetworkPrioritizerService3" will be used. If Max Payload and 
  Max Throughput are not defined, then they will not be limiting factors. For this release, 0.5.0, Max Payload will only be used for processors that custom 
  implement that feature. RPGs will not support max payloads until 0.6.0. Additionally, since connection queues aren't prioritized, you must have a live connection
  for your data to send it. Since connection queues can't be re-prioritized, this can create a starvation problem. The configuration is required to account for this.
    
   Controller Services:
   - name: NetworkPrioritizerService
     id: 2438e3c8-015a-1000-79ca-83af40ec1883
     class: NetworkPrioritizerService
     Properties:
         Linked Services: NetworkPrioritizerService2,NetworkPrioritizerService3
   - name: NetworkPrioritizerService2
     id: 2438e3c8-015a-1000-79ca-83af40ec1884
     class: NetworkPrioritizerService
     Properties:
         Network Controllers: en0,en1
         Max Throughput: 1,024,1024
         Max Payload: 1024
   - name: NetworkPrioritizerService3
     id: 2438e3c8-015a-1000-79ca-83af40ec1884
     class: NetworkPrioritizerService
     Properties:
         Network Controllers: en2,en3
         Max Throughput: 1,024,1024
         Max Payload: 1,024,1024
         
### Running
After completing a [build](#building), the application can be run by issuing the following from :

    $ ./bin/minifi.sh start

By default, this will make use of a config.yml located in the conf directory.  This configuration file location can be altered by adjusting the property `nifi.flow.configuration.file` in minifi.properties located in the conf directory.

### Stopping  

MiNiFi can then be stopped by issuing:

    $ ./bin/minifi.sh stop

### Installing as a service

MiNiFi can also be installed as a system service using minifi.sh with an optional "service name" (default: minifi)

    $ ./bin/minifi.sh install [service name]
    
### Deploying
MiNiFi C++ comes with a deployment script. This will build and package minifi. Additionally, a file named build_output will be
created within the build directory that contains a manifest of build artifacts.

    $ deploy.sh <build identifier> 

The build identifier will be carried with the deployed binary for the configuration you specify. By default all extensions will be built.
    
### Managing MiNFI C++ through the MiNiFi Controller

The MiNiFi controller is an executable in the bin directory that can be used to control the MiNFi C++ agent while it runs. Currently the controller will let you stop subcomponents within a running instance, clear queues, get the status of queues, and update the flow for a warm re-deploy.

The minificontroller can track a single MiNiFi C++ agent through the use of three options. Port is required.
The hostname is not and will default to localhost. Additionally, controller.socket.local.any.interface allows
you to bind to any address when using localhost. Otherwise, we will bind only to the loopback adapter so only
minificontroller on the local host can control the agent:

	$ controller.socket.host=localhost
	$ controller.socket.port=9998
	$ controller.socket.local.any.interface=true/false ( default false)

These are defined by default to the above values. If the port option is left undefined, the MiNiFi controller
will be disabled in your deployment.

 The executable is stored in the bin directory and is titled minificontroller. Available commands are listed below.
 Note that with all commands an immediate response by the agent isn't guaranteed. In all cases the agent assumes the role of validating that a response was received, but execution of said command may take some time depending on a number of factors to include persistent storage type, size of queues, and speed of hardware. 
 
 #### Specifying connecting information
 
   ./minificontroller --host "host name" --port "port"

        * By default these options use those defined in minifi.properties and are not required

 #### Start Command
 
   ./minificontroller --start "component name"
 
 #### Stop command 
   ./minificontroller --stop "component name"
   	  
 #### List connections command
   ./minificontroller --list connections
      
 #### List components command
   ./minificontroller --list components
 
 #### Clear connection command
   ./minificontroller --clear "connection name"
      
 #### GetSize command
   ./minificontroller --getsize "connection name"

       * Returns the size of the connection. The current size along with the max will be reported
 
 #### Update flow
   ./minificontroller --updateflow "config yml"
    
       *Updates the flow file reference and performs a warm re-deploy.
 
 #### Get full connection command     
   ./minificontroller --getfull 
   
       *Provides a list of full connections, if any.

## Contributing

We welcome all contributions to Apache MiNiFi. To make development easier, we've included
the linter for the Google Style guide. Google provides an Eclipse formatter for their style
guide. It is located [here](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/eclipse-cpp-google-style.xml).
New contributions are expected to follow the Google style guide when it is reasonable.
Additionally, all new files must include a copy of the Apache License Header.

MiNiFi C++ contains a dynamic loading mechanism that loads arbitrary objects. To maintain
consistency of development amongst the NiFi ecosystem, it is called a class loader. If you
are contributing a custom Processor or Controller Service, the mechanism to register your class
into the default class loader is a pragma definition named:

    REGISTER_RESOURCE(CLASSNAME);

To use this include REGISTER_RESOURCE(YourClassName); in your header file. The default class
loader will make instnaces of YourClassName available for inclusion.  

Once you have completed your changes, including source code and tests, you can verify that
you follow the Google style guide by running the following command:
     $ make linter.
This will provide output for all source files.
