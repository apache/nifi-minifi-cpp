## Features

Apache NiFi - MiNiFi C++ is a complementary data collection approach that supplements the core tenets of [NiFi](http://nifi.apache.org/) in dataflow management, focusing on the collection of data at the source of its creation.  The C++ implementation is an additional implementation to the one in Java with the aim of an even smaller resource footprint.

Specific goals for MiNiFi are comprised of:
- small and lightweight footprint
- central management of agents
- generation of data provenance
- integration with NiFi for follow-on dataflow management and full chain of custody of information

Perspectives of the role of MiNiFi should be from the perspective of the agent acting immediately at, or directly adjacent to, source sensors, systems, or servers.

## Caveats
* 0.2.0 represents a non-GA release, APIs and interfaces are subject to change
* Build and usage currently only supports Linux and OS X environments. Providing the needed tooling to support Windows will be established as part of [MINIFI-34](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MINIFI-34).
* Using Site to Site requires the additional manual step of specifying the remote socket.  This being autonegotiated through NiFi's REST API is captured in [MINIFI-70](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MINIFI-70).
* The processors currently implemented include:
  * AppendHostInfo
  * ExecuteProcess
  * ExecuteScript
  * GetFile
  * GenerateFlowFile
  * InvokeHTTP
  * LogAttribute
  * ListenHTTP
  * ListenSyslog
  * PutFile
  * TailFile
  * MergeContent
  * ExtractText
  * CompressContent
  * FocusArchive
  * UnfocusArchive
* Provenance events generation is supported and are persisted using RocksDB.

## System Requirements

### To build

#### Utilities
* CMake
  * 3.1 or greater
* gcc
  * 4.8.4 or greater
* g++
  * 4.8.4 or greater

### Cleaning
Remove the build directory created above.
```
# ~/Development/code/apache/nifi-minifi-cpp on git:master
$ rm -rf ./build
```

### Configuring
The 'conf' directory in the root contains a template config.yml document.  

This is compatible with the format used with the Java MiNiFi application.  Currently, a subset of the configuration is supported and MiNiFi C++ is currently compatible with version 1 of the MiNiFi YAML schema.
Additional information on the YAML format for the config.yml and schema versioning can be found in the [MiNiFi System Administrator Guide](https://nifi.apache.org/minifi/system-admin-guide.html).

Additionally, users can utilize the MiNiFi Toolkit Converter (version 0.0.1 - schema version 1) to aid in creating a flow configuration from a generated template exported from a NiFi instance.  The MiNiFi Toolkit Converter tool can be downloaded from http://nifi.apache.org/minifi/download.html under the `MiNiFi Toolkit Binaries` section.  Information on its usage is available at https://nifi.apache.org/minifi/minifi-toolkit.html.

    nifi.c2.enable=true

	#specify metrics classes
	nifi.flow.metrics.classes=DeviceInformation,SystemInformation,ProcessMetrics
	
	#specify C2 protocol

### Configuring Volatile and NO-OP Repositories
Each of the repositories can be configured to be volatile ( state kept in memory and flushed
 upon restart ) or persistent. Currently, the flow file and provenance repositories can persist
 to RocksDB. The content repository will persist to the local file system if a volatile repo
 is not configured.

 To configure the repositories:

     in minifi.properties
     # For Volatile Repositories:
     nifi.flowfile.repository.class.name=VolatileFlowFileRepository
     nifi.provenance.repository.class.name=VolatileProvenanceRepository
     nifi.content.repository.class.name=VolatileContentRepository

     # configuration options
     # maximum number of entries to keep in memory
     nifi.volatile.repository.options.flowfile.max.count=10000
     # maximum number of bytes to keep in memory, also limited by option above
     nifi.volatile.repository.options.flowfile.max.bytes=1M

     # maximum number of entries to keep in memory
     nifi.volatile.repository.options.provenance.max.count=10000
     # maximum number of bytes to keep in memory, also limited by option above
     nifi.volatile.repository.options.provenance.max.bytes=1M

     # maximum number of entries to keep in memory
     nifi.volatile.repository.options.content.max.count=100000
     # maximum number of bytes to keep in memory, also limited by option above
     nifi.volatile.repository.options.content.max.bytes=1M
     # limits locking for the content repository
     nifi.volatile.repository.options.content.minimal.locking=true
     
     # For NO-OP Repositories:
	 nifi.flowfile.repository.class.name=NoOpRepository
     nifi.provenance.repository.class.name=NoOpRepository

 #### Caveats
 Systems that have limited memory must be cognizant of the options above. Limiting the max count for the number of entries limits memory consumption but also limits the number of events that can be stored. If you are limiting the amount of volatile content you are configuring, you may have excessive session rollback due to invalid stream errors that occur when a claim cannot be found.

 The content repository has a default option for "minimal.locking" set to true. This will attempt to use lock free structures. This may or may not be optimal as this requires additional additional searching of the underlying vector. This may be optimal for cases where max.count is not excessively high. In cases where object permanence is low within the repositories, minimal locking will result in better performance. If there are many processors and/or timing is such that the content repository fills up quickly, performance may be reduced. In all cases a locking cache is used to avoid the worst case complexity of O(n) for the content repository; however, this caching is more heavily used when "minimal.locking" is set to false.

### Provenance Report

    Add Provenance Reporting to config.yml
    Provenance Reporting:
      scheduling strategy: TIMER_DRIVEN
      scheduling period: 1 sec
      url: http://localhost:8080/nifi
      port uuid: 471deef6-2a6e-4a7d-912a-81cc17e3a204
      batch size: 100

### Http Configuration Listener

    Http Configuration Listener will pull flow file configuration from the remote command control server,
    validate and apply the new flow configuration

    in minifi.properties

    nifi.configuration.listener.type=http
    nifi.configuration.listener.http.url=https://localhost:8080
    nifi.configuration.listener.pull.interval=1 sec

    if you want to enable client certificate
    nifi.https.need.ClientAuth=true
    nifi.https.client.certificate=./conf/client.pem
    nifi.https.client.private.key=./conf/client.key
    nifi.https.client.pass.phrase=./conf/password
    nifi.https.client.ca.certificate=./conf/nifi-cert.pem

### REST API access

    Configure REST API user name and password
    nifi.rest.api.user.name=admin
    nifi.rest.api.password=password

    if you want to enable client certificate
    nifi.https.need.ClientAuth=true
    nifi.https.client.certificate=./conf/client.pem
    nifi.https.client.private.key=./conf/client.key
    nifi.https.client.pass.phrase=./conf/password
    nifi.https.client.ca.certificate=./conf/nifi-cert.pem

### UID generation

MiNiFi needs to generate many unique identifiers in the course of operations.  There are a few different uid implementations available that can be configured in minifi-uid.properties.

Implementation for uid generation can be selected using the uid.implementation property values:
1. time - use uuid_generate_time (default option if the file or property value is missing or invalid)
2. random - use uuid_generate_random
3. uuid_default - use uuid_generate (will attempt to use uuid_generate_random and fall back to uuid_generate_time if no high quality randomness is available)
4. minifi_uid - use custom uid algorthim

If minifi_uuid is selected MiNiFi will use a custom uid algorthim consisting of first N bits device identifier, second M bits as bottom portion of a timestamp where N + M = 64, the last 64 bits is an atomic incrementor.

This is faster than the random uuid generator and encodes the device id and a timestamp into every value, making tracing of flowfiles, etc easier.

It does require more configuration.  uid.minifi.device.segment.bits is used to specify how many bits at the beginning to reserve for the device identifier.  It also puts a limit on how many distinct devices can be used.  With the default of 16 bits, there are a maximum of 65,535 unique device identifiers that can be used.  The 48 bit timestamp won't repeat for almost 9,000 years.  With 24 bits for the device identifier, there are a maximum of 16,777,215 unique device identifiers and the 40 bit timestamp won't repeat for about 35 years.

Additionally, a unique hexadecimal uid.minifi.device.segment should be assigned to each MiNiFi instance.

### Controller Services
 If you need to reference a controller service in your config.yml file, use the following template. In the example, below, ControllerServiceClass is the name of the class defining the controller Service. ControllerService1
 is linked to ControllerService2, and requires the latter to be started for ControllerService1 to start.

	Controller Services:
      - name: ControllerService1
 	    id: 2438e3c8-015a-1000-79ca-83af40ec1974
	  	class: ControllerServiceClass
	  	Properties:
	      Property one: value
	      Linked Services:
	        - value: ControllerService2
	  - name: ControllerService2
	    id: 2438e3c8-015a-1000-79ca-83af40ec1992
	  	class: ControllerServiceClass
	  	Properties:


### Running
After completing a [build](#building), the application can be run by issuing the following from :

    $ ./bin/minifi.sh start

By default, this will make use of a config.yml located in the conf directory.  This configuration file location can be altered by adjusting the property `nifi.flow.configuration.file` in minifi.properties located in the conf directory.

### Stopping  

MiNiFi can then be stopped by issuing:

    $ ./bin/minifi.sh stop

### Installing as a service

MiNiFi can also be installed as a system service using minifi.sh with an optional "service name" (default: minifi)

    $ ./bin/minifi.sh install [service name]

### Extensions

Please see [Extensions.md](Extensions.md) on how to build and run conditionally built dependencies and extensions.

## Documentation
See https://nifi.apache.org/minifi for the latest documentation.

## Contributing

We welcome all contributions to Apache MiNiFi. To make development easier, we've included
the linter for the Google Style guide. Google provides an Eclipse formatter for their style
guide. It is located [here](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/eclipse-cpp-google-style.xml).
New contributions are expected to follow the Google style guide when it is reasonable.
Additionally, all new files must include a copy of the Apache License Header.

MiNiFi C++ contains a dynamic loading mechanism that loads arbitrary objects. To maintain
consistency of development amongst the NiFi ecosystem, it is called a class loader. If you
are contributing a custom Processor or Controller Service, the mechanism to register your class
into the default class loader is a pragma definition named:

    REGISTER_RESOURCE(CLASSNAME);

To use this include REGISTER_RESOURCE(YourClassName); in your header file. The default class
loader will make instnaces of YourClassName available for inclusion.  

Once you have completed your changes, including source code and tests, you can verify that
you follow the Google style guide by running the following command:
     $ make linter.
This will provide output for all source files.
